Add timestamps to graph
Make window more responsive
Dynamically scale subdivisions
Highlight dead pings (and bad pings?) - console-logging now in place.
Account for processing times in delay (also fixing this would probably help responsiveness)
Cap graph height - add label to out-of-range?
Pre-resolve URL so we aren't waiting for DNS every ping

#  Add fallback settings, in case `settings.json` isn't present
#  Consider bar, histogram and plot -styles of graph
#  Add dark/light theme option
